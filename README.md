# Charlies-Angels
MPF code for GTB  Sys1 Charlies Angels pinball.

This is an attempt to recreate the original GTB Charlies Angels code in MPF

It can run on LISY 1 hardware or in MPF monitor.

  To switch between these ways of running edit the config.yaml file around line 10,
  
    select one only config, comment out (#) the other.
    
      gtb-lights.yaml        will run on LISY1 hardware
      
      monitor-lights.yaml    will run with the MPF monitor
      
 An attract light show has been added.
 Sounds have been added when running in monitor.  I will hopefully add then to the Lisy hardware.
